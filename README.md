# Hello, I'm Jack

I’m a software engineer who builds reliable, scalable systems — the kind that deploy cleanly, scale predictably, and fail gracefully. Most of my work lives where code meets operations, with Linux as the common thread tying it all together.

I care about systems that explain themselves, pipelines that don’t wake you up at 2 a.m., and solutions that favor clarity over cleverness. My goal is simple: code that runs clean today and makes sense six months from now.

When I’m off the clock, I’m usually tinkering in my home lab — experimenting with self-hosted infrastructure, automation tools, and new ways to make services behave better in the wild. Think of it as my personal sandbox for production-ready ideas.

If you’re into open infrastructure, clean automation, or just like reading well-documented code, you’ll probably feel at home here.
