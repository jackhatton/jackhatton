# Hello, I'm Jack!

I'm a software engineer who spends most of my time developing reliable and scalable systems. I strive to build outcomes that are reproducible, observable, and maintainable, with Linux as the foundation for nearly everything I do.

My work often sits at the intersection of development and operations — writing code that deploys cleanly, scales predictably, and fails gracefully when something goes wrong. I care about systems that explain themselves and pipelines that don’t surprise anyone at 2 a.m. Whether it’s a web service, a build process, or an automation workflow, I tend to favor simplicity and clarity over clever abstractions.

Outside of work, I’m an avid home labber. You’ll find traces of that here — bits of self-hosted infrastructure, tooling experiments, and utilities that make managing servers or services a little less painful. I treat my personal projects as a proving ground for ideas I can bring back into production environments.

If you’re into open infrastructure, clean automation, or just like reading well-documented code, you’ll probably feel at home here.

I’m always open to conversations about open-source, infrastructure, and the craft of building dependable systems.
